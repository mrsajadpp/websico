### 3.3 Middleware

Enhance your application's functionality with middleware, allowing for custom processing of requests and responses.

### 3.4 Extensibility

Easily extend Websico's capabilities through middleware or by creating custom plugins tailored to your project's needs.

## 4. Middleware

app.use((req, res, next) => {
    console.log(`Received request at ${req.url}`);
    next();
});
```

## 5. Routing

// Handling GET request at the root endpoint
app.get('/', (req, res) => {
    res.send("Welcome to Websico!");

    res.json({ message: "Data received successfully" });
});
```

## 6. Extensibility

Websico provides a robust architecture for extending functionality. Consider creating custom plugins for your specific use cases.

```javascript
// Handling 404 errors
app.use((req, res) => {
    res.status(404).send("Page not found");
});

// Handling other errors
app.use((err, req, res, next) => {
    console.error(err.stack);
    res.status(500).send("Something went wrong!");
});
```

## 8. Expressive API

Websico's API is designed to be clear and expressive, making it easy to understand and work with.
